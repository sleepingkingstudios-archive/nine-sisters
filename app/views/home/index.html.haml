%h1 About This Site
%p
  This site runs on
  #{link_to "Ruby on Rails", "http://rubyonrails.org/"}, which I recommend
  highly. The views are written in
  #{link_to "Haml", "http://haml-lang.com/"}
  and styled using
  #{link_to "Sass", "http://sass-lang.com/"},
  with a little
  #{link_to "Markdown", "http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"}
  magic (powered by
  #{link_to "Redcarpet", "https://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet"}).
  For client-side scripting made easy, I'm using the excellent
  #{link_to "jQuery", "http://jquery.com/"}
  library.

%p
  This site also uses the
  = link_to "Solarized", "http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized"
  theme, by Ethan Schoonover.

%h2 About the Author
%p= lighten("(with apologies to Sir J.M. Barrie and J. Michael Straczynski)")

%h3 Who Are You?
%p
  My name is Rob Smith, I am an engineer (by training) and a programmer (by
  trade). I currently work as a Flash developer for Fantage.com and work on
  various projects in my spare time, some of which I hope to showcase here.

%div.author-bio{ :style => "display: none;" }
  %h3 What Do You Want?
  %p
    To put smiles on people's faces. To tell stories that entertain, enlighten,
    and explore the intersections and boundaries of narrative and play. Or, in
    the words of Sharon Apple:
  %blockquote
    "It's what you want to give to each person. Your feelings, the feelings you
    believe they should have. To give to the one you love her greatest dreams.
    To give her the ultimate emotion - the feeling of total life, a vision of
    all the world's colours at once. That is the reason for my existence."
  
  %h3 Where Are You Going?
  %p
    Second star to the right, and straight on 'till morning.
  
  %h3 Who Do You Serve, And Who Do You Trust?
  %p
    I am currently working as a Flash developer for Fantage.com, building games
    and content for their online platform, although someday I would like to
    transition from development into game design.

%h2 About Sleeping King Studios
%p
  You may be thinking that one designer on a laptop does not a
  &ldquo;studios&rdquo; make. You, sir or ma'am, are absolutely correct. But I
  like the name, so I'm keeping it.
